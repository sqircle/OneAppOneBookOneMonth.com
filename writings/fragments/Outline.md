# Intro

## I'm prototyping my dream app in one month.

I'm documenting it in a book [Make Crap](http://makecrap.com). The app is a design tool, my dream app. I'm taking the
power of a graphics editor and the flexibility of the web and bringing them together in one canvas. You can read more
about it at [SqircleApp.com](http://sqircleapp.com)

Why am I doing this? Because I cant finish things. I cant go beyond the idea phase.

I want to make this app so badly. I have wanted to for years. I have the skills to make it, but not the skills to make it _happen_. Something always stops it. 

I say _something_ but I mean _person_, that person is _me_. I get stuck on making something perfect and never make.

Maybe the mockup didn't convey what I wanted. Maybe the language wasn't right. Lua? LISP?

Which LISP should I use? Clojure? Ewww that's Java. I'll go with Racket. Or maybe Chicken; that converts to C. I could use C and Vala and then it would be really fast. Then I could construct the UI bits in LISP. Or maybe QML? I could use
QT, C++ and QML for the UI. Then it would cross-platform, that would be awesome.

Wow, January went by fast. Oh shit, I got client work to do.

Actually, you know what, Lua has pretty great GEGL bindings, I'd have to do them myself if I used Chicken. Yeah, I should with Lua for scripting. Then I could use Vala to avoid those dirty C bits. 

It never got made. 

I'm done playing around. I'm done seeking perfection. I'm tired of staring at unfinished ideas and half-baked concepts.
I'm tired of procrastinating. I'm fed up with not finishing. I'm going to make something. Now. Not later.
